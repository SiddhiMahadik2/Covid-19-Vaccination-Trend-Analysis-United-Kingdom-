# Covid-19-Vaccination-Trend-Analysis-United-Kingdom-
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) research examines a large dataset that captures the COVID-19 vaccination trends in different locations of the United Kingdom. The data includes essential information such as the name of the location, code, year, month, quarter, day, working day indicators, and the number of doses provided (first, second, and third). This research, consisting of 904 records, seeks to reveal significant insights, patterns, and connections within the vaccination data. Its purpose is to enhance comprehension of the vaccination landscape in the UK, including regional variations. We will use statistical approaches, visualisations, and data exploration to analyse the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in various aspects of the UK. This will involve identifying patterns, addressing missing data, and drawing relevant conclusions.
